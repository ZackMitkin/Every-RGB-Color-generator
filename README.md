# Every-RGB-Color-generator
This program will take a very long time, but will make a file that stores all the rgb values possible, maybe could be useful? idk wish computers could do it faster

Probably very un optimized, and there must be faster ways, but it works if you got the time.
No licence on it, take it, claim it, use it, idc I dont need credit for this 5 min project lol
